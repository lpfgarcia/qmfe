\title{Measures of dimensionality}
\usage{
dimensionality(...)

dimensionality(...)

\method{dimensionality}{default}(x, features = "all", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Not used.}

\item{x}{A data.frame contained only the input attributes.}

\item{features}{A list of features names or \code{"all"} to include all them.}
}
\value{
A list named by the requested dimensionality measure.
}
\description{
These measures give an indicative of data sparsity. They capture how sparse 
a datasets tend to have regions of low density. These regions are know to be 
more difficult to extract good classification and regression models.
}
\details{
The following features are allowed for this method:
 \describe{
   \item{"T2"}{Average number of points per dimension (T2) is given by the 
     ratio between the number of examples and dimensionality of the dataset.}
   \item{"T3"}{Average number of points per PCA (T3) is similar to T2, but 
     uses the number of PCA components needed to represent 95% of data 
     variability as the base of data sparsity assessment.}
   \item{"T4"}{Ratio of the PCA Dimension to the Original (T4) estimates the
     proportion of relevant and the original dimensions for a dataset.}
 }
